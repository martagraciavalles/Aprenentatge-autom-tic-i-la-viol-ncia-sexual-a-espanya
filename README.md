>Spain is committed to prioritising the expansion of data and statistics on violence against women in order to contribute to raising social awareness and to the success of public and private actions. Of all women aged 16 and over living in Spain, more than 13% have suffered sexual violence at least once in their lives. This study focuses on the analysis of articles on sexual violence published by the most popular media in Spain, within a context in which we want to understand how this issue is addressed and reported to society. The main objective is to develop an automated model that can identify and group articles related to the same case, as well as classify the relationship between the aggressor and the victim and determine whether it is a case of sexual, group or individual violence. Thus, examining the main characteristics of these in order to compare it with official statistics from the Ministry of Equality.


## Data and code release
The project consists on three main phases, which correspond with the directories of the present repository: 
1. **[Cases classification](https://github.com/martagraciavalles/spanish_media_coverage_sexual_violence/tree/main/cases_classification)**: News articles were grouped according to the sexual violence case they share information about. The clustering was done in two steps: first, we computed the similarity of each pair of cases; next, we make the graph with articles based on this similarity. 

2. **[Articles classification](https://github.com/marilenabudan/spanish_media_coverage_sexual_violence/tree/main/articles_analysis)**: We classify items in two different ways. According to the number of perpetrators involved in the case and according to the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator.

3. **[Vocabulary analysis](https://github.com/marilenabudan/spanish_media_coverage_sexual_violence/tree/main/articles_analysis)**: We analyse the vocabulary used in the different types of cases through the different grammatical categories (adj, adv, noun, verb).
